# üöÄ Azure DevOps + React Web App Deployment

## Project Overview
This project is a **React frontend web application** deployed on **Azure Web App** using **Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines**. The project demonstrates end-to-end modern web application deployment with a focus on **continuous integration**, **continuous deployment**, and **zero-downtime delivery** using **App Service deployment slots** (Test & Production).

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React + Vite (or CRA)  
- **Cloud:** Azure Web App, App Service Slots (Test & Prod)  
- **CI/CD:** Azure Pipelines (Build + Release)  
- **Version Control:** Azure Repos / GitHub  

---

## üîÑ CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- Build pipeline triggered on **push / pull request**  
- Steps: `restore ‚Üí build ‚Üí archive build ‚Üí publish artifact`  

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
- Release pipeline with **slots (Test ‚Üí Prod)**  
- **Pre-deployment:** approvals  
- **Post-deployment:** swap + monitoring

## üåê Deployment

### App Service Plan
The project is hosted on **Azure App Service**. Depending on cost and performance requirements, the **App Service Plan** can be scaled:  
- **B1 Basic:** Small-scale apps with custom domain support.  
- **F1 Free Tier:** Ideal for testing and learning purposes, limited resources, free of cost.  

### Deployment Slots
Azure App Service **slots** enable **zero-downtime deployments**:  
- **Test Slot:** Deploy and test new builds without affecting production.  
- **Production Slot:** Live application accessed by end users.  
- **Swap Mechanism:** Verified builds in Test slot are swapped to Production instantly.

## üìä Deployment Strategies

### Implemented: Blue-Green Deployment (Slots)
- Two environments (**Blue = Production**, **Green = Test**) run in parallel.  
- New code deployed to **Green/Test slot** and validated.  
- After verification, **swap with Production slot**.  

**Advantages:**  
- Zero downtime  
- Easy rollback  
- Safe testing in production-like environment  

**Considerations:**  
- Extra cost due to multiple slots  
- Requires database/data synchronization if changes are made
